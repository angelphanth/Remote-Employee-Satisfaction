# Remote-Employee-Satisfaction
## Microsoft x BrainStation Stay at Home Hackathon

This project was done in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/angelphanth">Angel Phanthanourak</a> as part of a Microsoft-led hackathon running from April 27-29, 2020.

Comprised of 3 UX/UI designers, 3 web developers and 2 data scientists, our team created VirtuOffice - a digital office environment to make it easier for remote workers to socialize with their colleagues and leaders so that they can feel more strongly integrated within their employerâ€™s culture.

## The Purpose

<i>The COVID-19 pandemic is a terrible agent of change and we have an opportunity to leverage this event to create new tools and processes that will help people thrive both during, and after the self isolation time. We have a chance to reset and fundamentally change the way we work.</i>

<i>Statistics Canada found that 4.7 million Canadians who don't normally work from home started to in response to the pandemic, based on a survey conducted the week of March 22.</i>

<i>According to a survey conducted by Vancouver-based polling firm Research Co., 73% of Canadians surveyed think the working from home trend will continue after the COVID-19 pandemic has ended.</i>
  
<i>Can we use this moment to create better Work From Home experiences? <strong>You have 3 days to create a digital prototype and/or solution to support a better Work From Home experience.</strong></i>

## Our Solution

We expect some level of working from home to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our solution is a digital office environment, VirtuOffice, to bridge the gap of feeling excluded, disconnected and disengaged in the workplace culture - a challenge many remote employees face.

Implementing gamification in VirtuOffice, remote employees navigate their virtual office environment with an avatar, engaging with their co-workers by inviting them for coffee chats and other opportunities to build a connection. Employees can earn 'points' through these actions and others, such as completing a satisfaction survey. These points could be spent on decorating their VirtuOffice with cosmetic decorative elements such as flowers, paintings, or avatar outfits.

Using the hypothetical, generated data from employee surveys, we created a dashboard for Human Resources and Team Managers to measure working-from-home days, gage productivity, and overall employee satisfaction.
